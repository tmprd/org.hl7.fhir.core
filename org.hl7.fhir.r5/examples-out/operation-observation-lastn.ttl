  fhir:description [ fhir:v "The *lastn query* meets the common need for searching for the most recent or last n=number of observations for a subject. For example, retrieving the last 5 temperatures for a patient to view trends or fetching the most recent laboratory results or vitals signs. To ask a server to return the last n=number of observations, the *lastn* query uses the [normal search parameters](observation.html#search) defined for the Observation resource.  However, rather than their normal use, they are interpreted as inputs - i.e.. instead of requiring that the resources literally contain the search parameters, they are passed to a server algorithm of some kind that uses them to determine the most appropriate matches.\n\nThe request for a lastn query SHALL include:\n\n* A `$lastn` operation parameter\n*  A subject using either the `patient` or `subject`  search parameter\n*  A `category` parameter and/or a search parameter that contains a code element in its FHIRpath expression.  ( e.g., `code` or `code-value-concept`)\n\nThe request for a lastn query MAY include:\n\n* Other Observation search parameters and modifiers\n\nThe response from a lastn query is a set of observations:\n\n*  Filtered by additional parameters\n   * If not explicitly filtered by status then will include statuses of 'entered-in-error'\n* 'GROUP BY' `Observation.code`\n   * Codes SHALL be considered equivalent if the `coding.value` *and* `coding.system` are the same.\n   * Text only codes SHALL be treated and grouped based on the text.\n   * For codes with translations (multiple codings), the code translations are assumed to be equal and the grouping by code SHALL follow the transitive property of equality.\n\nfor example:\n\n|Observation.code for observation a|Observation.code for observation b|Observation.code for observation c|number of groups [codes/text in each group]|    \n|---|---|---|---|     \n|a|b|c | 3 [a],[b],[c]|    \n|a|b|a,c | 2 [a.c],[b]|     \n|a|b|a,b | 1 [a,b]|    \n|'textM'|'Text'|'t e x t'|3 ['text'],['Text'],['t e x t']|\n\n* Sorted from most recent effective time to the oldest effective time. For further guidance, refer here on [sorting](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#_sort).\n* Limited to the number of requested responses per group specified by the optional *max* query parameter\n  * In case of a tie - when the effective times for >1 Observations are equal - both will be returned.  Therefore, more Observations may be returned than is specified in *max*.  For example, 4 Observations instead of 3 if the 3rd and 4th most recent observation had the same effective time.\n* If no maximum number is given then only the most recent Observation in each group is returned.\n\nThe set of returned observations should represent distinct real-world observations and not the same observation with changes in status or versions. If there are no matches, the *lastn* query SHALL return an empty search set with no error, but may include an operation outcome with further advice."] ; #
