  fhir:description [ fhir:v "This operation is used to return all the information related to one or more patients described in the resource or context on which this operation is invoked. The response is a bundle of type \"searchset\". At a minimum, the patient resource(s) itself is returned, along with any other resources that the server has that are related to the patient(s), and that are available for the given user. The server also returns whatever resources are needed to support the records - e.g. linked practitioners, medications, locations, organizations etc.   \r\rThe intended use for this operation is to provide a patient with access to their entire record (e.g. \"Blue Button\"), or for provider or other user to perform a bulk data download.  The server SHOULD return at least all resources that it has that are in the patient compartment for the identified patient(s), and any resource referenced from those, including binaries and attachments. The server SHOULD resolve version-specific references by returning the explicitly named version. Implementation guides may make additional rules about how much information that is returned."] ; #
