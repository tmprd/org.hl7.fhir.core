  fhir:description [ fhir:v "The Statistics operation performs a set of statistical calculations on a set of clinical measurements such as a blood pressure as stored on the server.  This operation evaluates [Observation](observation.html) resources having valueQuantity elements that have UCUM unit codes.      \r\rAlternatively, the [measure workflow pattern](measure.html) should be used when defining a quality measure (e.g. a description of how to calculate a particular measurement or set of measurements) as part of a workflow. \r\rThe set of Observations is defined by 4 parameters:\r\r*  the subject of the observations for which the statistics are being generated (`subject`)\r* which observations to generate statistics for (`code` and `system`, or `coding`)\r* the time period over which to generate statistics 'duration` or `period`)\r* the set of statistical analyses to return (`statistic`)\r\rPossible statistical analyses (see [StatisticsCode](valueset-observation-statistics.html)):\r\r - **average** (\"Average\"): The [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **maximum** (\"Maximum\"): The [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_element) value of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **minimum** (\"Minimum\"): The [minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element) value of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **count** (\"Count\"): The [number] of valid measurements over the stated period that contributed to the other statistical outputs.\r\n - **total-count** (\"Total Count\"): The total [number] of valid measurements over the stated period, including observations that were ignored because they did not contain valid result values.\r\n - **median** (\"Median\"): The [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **std-dev** (\"Standard Deviation\"): The [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **sum** (\"Sum\"): The [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **variance** (\"Variance\"): The [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **20-percent** (\"20th Percentile\"): The 20th [Percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **80-percent** (\"80th Percentile\"): The 80th [Percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **4-lower** (\"Lower Quartile\"): The lower [Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) Boundary of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **4-upper** (\"Upper Quartile\"): The upper [Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) Boundary of N measurements over the stated period.\r\n - **4-dev** (\"Quartile Deviation\"): The difference between the upper and lower [Quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) is called the Interquartile range. (IQR = Q3-Q1) Quartile deviation or Semi-interquartile range is one-half the difference between the first and the third quartiles.\r\n - **5-1** (\"1st Quintile\"): The lowest of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.\r\n - **5-2** (\"2nd Quintile\"): The second of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.\r\n - **5-3** (\"3rd Quintile\"): The third of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.\r\n - **5-4** (\"4th Quintile\"): The fourth of four values that divide the N measurements into a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population.\r\n - **skew** (\"Skew\"): Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or even undefined.  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness).\r\n - **kurtosis** (\"Kurtosis\"): Kurtosis  is a measure of the \"tailedness\" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable.   Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis).\r\n - **regression** (\"Regression\"): Linear regression is an approach for modeling two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression)  This Statistic code will return both a gradient and an intercept value.\r\n\r\rIf successful, the operation returns an Observation resource for each code with the results of the statistical calculations as component value pairs where the component code = the statistical code. The Observation also contains the input parameters `patient`,`code` and `duration` parameters. If unsuccessful, an [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) with an error message will be returned.\r\rThe client can request that all the observations on which the statistics are based be returned as well, using the include parameter. If an include parameter is specified, a limit may also be specified; the sources observations are subsetted at the server's discretion if count > limit.
