The AdverseEvent resource also extends to potential or avoided events that could have had such effects. There are two major domains where the AdverseEvent resource is expected to be used. One is in clinical care reported adverse events and the other is in reporting adverse events in clinical  research trial management.  Adverse events can be reported by healthcare providers, patients, caregivers or by medical products manufacturers.  Given the differences between these two concepts, we recommend consulting the domain specific implementation guides when implementing the AdverseEvent Resource.

While the term “document” implies a more narrow focus, for this resource this “document” encompasses *any* serialized object with a mime-type, it includes formal patient-centric documents (CDA), clinical notes, scanned paper, non-patient specific documents like policy text, as well as a photo, video, or audio recording acquired or used in healthcare.  The DocumentReference resource provides metadata about the document so that the document can be discovered and managed.  The actual content may be inline base64 encoded data or provided by direct reference.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Dosage\">Dosage</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">Dosage</td>\n              <td>Dosage Type: Indicates how the medication is/was taken or should be taken by the patient.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Duration\">Duration</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">Duration</td>\n              <td>Duration Type: A length of time.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-ElementDefinition\">ElementDefinition</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">ElementDefinition</td>\n              <td>ElementDefinition Type: Captures constraints on each element within the resource, profile, or extension.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Encounter\">Encounter</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">Encounter</td>\n              <td>An interaction between healthcare provider(s), and/or patient(s) for the purpose of providing healthcare service(s) or assessing the health status of patient(s).</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-EncounterHistory\">EncounterHistory</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">EncounterHistory</td>\n              <td>A record of significant events/milestones key data throughout the history of an Encounter</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Endpoint\">Endpoint</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">Endpoint</td>\n              <td>The technical details of an endpoint that can be used for electronic services, such as for web services providing XDS.b, a REST endpoint for another FHIR server, or a s/Mime email address.

The consumption information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a nutrition label, or from a clinician documenting observed intake.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-NutritionOrder\">NutritionOrder</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">NutritionOrder</td>\n              <td>A request to supply a diet, formula feeding (enteral) or oral nutritional supplement to an individual or group.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-NutritionProduct\">NutritionProduct</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">NutritionProduct</td>\n              <td>A food or supplement that is consumed by patients.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Observation\">Observation</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">Observation</td>\n              <td>Measurements and simple assertions made about a patient, device or other subject.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-ObservationDefinition\">ObservationDefinition</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">ObservationDefinition</td>\n              <td>Set of definitional characteristics for a kind of observation or measurement produced or consumed by an orderable health care service.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-oid\">oid</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">oid</td>\n              <td>oid type: An OID represented as a URI</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-OperationDefinition\">OperationDefinition</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">OperationDefinition</td>\n              <td>A formal computable definition of an operation (on the RESTful interface) or a named query (using the search interaction).</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-OperationOutcome\">OperationOutcome</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">OperationOutcome</td>\n              <td>A collection of error, warning, or information messages that result from a system action.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Organization\">Organization</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">Organization</td>\n              <td>A formally or informally recognized grouping of people or organizations formed for the purpose of achieving some form of collective action.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-OrganizationAffiliation\">OrganizationAffiliation</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">OrganizationAffiliation</td>\n              <td>Defines an affiliation/assotiation/relationship between 2 distinct organizations, that is not a part-of relationship/sub-division relationship.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-PackagedProductDefinition\">PackagedProductDefinition</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">PackagedProductDefinition</td>\n              <td>A medically related item or items, in a container or package.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>\n                <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-ParameterDefinition\">ParameterDefinition</a>\n              </td>\n              <td style=\"color: #cccccc\">ParameterDefinition</td>\n              <td>ParameterDefinition Type: The parameters to the module.
